#### Binary search tree

- single node -> leaf
- balance tree -> all leafs are at the same level
- branching factor -> the amount of children a tree has

#### Traversal - O(n) bcause we visit all nodes

Also called as DFS (Depth First Search)

(using a lot knowledge of recursion)

1. visit node

recurse -> good base case, prev recurse post steps

2. recurse left
3. recurse right

- 3 types:

* pre-order -> root, left, right -> root at the beginning
* in-order -> left, root, right -> root in the middle
* post-order -> left, right, root -> root at the end

#### Notes

- quick sort -> also a binary tree
- it's a stack like data structure
- !important: the DFS preserves the structure of the tree, meaning if we want to check if 2 trees are the same in both structure and values, we can use DFS to do so

e.g.:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

```
     1
    /
   2
  /
 3

```

if we compare the 1st and 2nd tree, they are the same, because in the DFS we visit the root first, then the left and right children, meaning they both go down the same path, so if we compare the 1st and 3rd tree, they are different, because the 3rd tree goes down the left path and see 3rd tree has 3 while 1st tree has undefined -> they are different
