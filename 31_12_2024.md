#### Binary search tree

- single node -> leaf
- balance tree -> all leafs are at the same level
- branching factor -> the amount of children a tree has

#### Traversal - O(n) bcause we visit all nodes

Also called as DFS (Depth First Search)

(using a lot knowledge of recursion)

1. visit node

recurse -> good base case, prev recurse post steps

2. recurse left
3. recurse right

- 3 types:

* pre-order -> root, left, right -> root at the beginning
* in-order -> left, root, right -> root in the middle
* post-order -> left, right, root -> root at the end

#### Notes

- quick sort -> also a binary tree
