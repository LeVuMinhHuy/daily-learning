#### Heap **(Priority Queue)**

- Min Heap: the parent is always smaller than the children
- Max Heap: the parent is always bigger than the children

e.g:

```
        50
      /     \
    71      100
   /  \     / \
  101  80 200  101
```

#### Implementation

- we can implement a heap with an array

```
[50, 71, 100, 101, 80, 200, 101]
```

- the parent of the node at index i is at index `(i - 1) / 2` (integer division, get the floor value)
- the left child of the node at index i is at index `2 \* i + 1`
- the right child of the node at index i is at index `2 \* i + 2`

#### Algorithm

##### Insert (min heap)

1. add the element to the end of the array
2. heapify up, by comparing the element with its parent, if the element is smaller than the parent, swap them

for example, if we want to insert 3 to the heap

```
[50, 71, 100, 101, 80, 200, 101, 3]
[50, 71, 3, 101, 80, 200, 101, 100]
[3, 71, 50, 101, 80, 200, 101, 100]
```

the complexity of the insert operation is O(log n) because we need to traverse the height of the tree

##### Delete (min heap)

1. remove the root
2. move the last element to the root
3. heapify down, by comparing the element with its children, if the element is bigger than the children, swap it with the smallest child

for example, if we want to delete the root (3)

`[3, 71, 50, 101, 80, 200, 101, 100]`

```
[100, 71, 50, 101, 80, 200, 101]
[50, 71, 100, 101, 80, 200, 101]
```

the complexity of the delete operation is O(log n) because we need to traverse the height of the tree

#### Notes

- it is self-balancing, meaning the height of the tree is always log n
- why is it called a priority queue? because we can use it to implement a priority queue, where we can insert elements with a priority and the heap will always return the element with the highest priority first . meaning we can get the min or max element in O(1) time immediately. it good for implementing a task scheduler, where we can schedule tasks with a priority and the heap will always return the task with the highest priority first

#### Complexity

- Insert: O(log n)
- Delete: O(log n)
- Find Min: O(1)
- Find Max: O(1)
- Find Parent: O(1)

#### Use Cases

- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Prim's algorithm
- Huffman coding
- Task scheduler
- Scheduling jobs
