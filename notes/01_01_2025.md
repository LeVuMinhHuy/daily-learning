#### BFS - Breadth First Search

- traverse level by level

#### Algorithm

1. create a queue
2. add the root to the queue
3. while the queue is not empty
   1. dequeue the first element from the queue
   2. visit the node and check if it is the target
   3. enqueue the children left and right to the queue
4. return false if the target is not found

e.g:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \ / \
4  5 6  7
```

- queue = [1]
- visit 1, add 1's children to the queue, queue = [2, 3]
- dequeue 1, visit 2, add 2's children to the queue, queue = [3, 4, 5]
- dequeue 2, visit 3, add 3's children to the queue, queue = [4, 5, 6, 7]
- dequeue 3, visit 4, add 4's children to the queue, queue = [5, 6, 7]
- dequeue 4, visit 5, add 5's children to the queue, queue = [6, 7]
- dequeue 5, visit 6, add 6's children to the queue, queue = [7]
- dequeue 6, visit 7, add 7's children to the queue, queue = []

now the list we visit is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], that is the level order traversal aka BFS

#### Why we need to use a queue here?

- because of the algorithm, we add the children to the list and remove the first element from the list, so we better use a queue to take advantage of the FIFO (First In First Out) property. because the complexity of adding and removing elements from the queue is O(1)

if we use something like a list, the complexity of removing the first element is O(n) because we need to shift all elements to the left

that is why we need to be careful about the data structure we use

for example we code this algorithm with javascript, if we use the array as a queue, we can use the shift method to remove the first element, but the complexity of the shift method is O(n) because it shifts all elements to the left. And since traversing the tree is O(n), the total complexity of the algorithm will be **O(n^2)**. But if we use a queue, the complexity of the algorithm will be **O(n)**

_Just remember that if it's BFS we need to use a queue_

#### Complexity

- O(n) because we visit all nodes

#### Notes

- BFS is a queue like data structure
- !important: the BFS does not preserve the structure of the tree, meaning if we want to check if 2 trees are the same in both structure and values, we can't use BFS to do so

e.g.:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

```
     1
    /
   2
  /
 3

```

if we compare the 1st and 2nd tree, they are the same. but if we compare the 1st and 3rd tree, they are still the same as those 2 trees does not go down the same path, it goes down by level, so while the 1st tree visit the right child and see 3, the 3rd tree goes down the left path and also see 3, so they are the same

That's the difference between DFS and BFS

Remember that DFS preserves the structure of the tree when traversal, but BFS does not
