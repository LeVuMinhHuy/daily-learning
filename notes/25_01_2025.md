#### SHA

- git commits come with a sha (a has with 0-9a-f characters)

- you can specify the first 7 characters of a sha for git to identify what you are referring to

- `git cat-file -p <sha>` will show you the contents of the commit

- tree is directory, blob is file

- git does not store diffs, it stores snapshots. meaning it stores the entire file every time you commit, and then you can restore all the files at any point in time with just the sha
