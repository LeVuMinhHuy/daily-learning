#### Wrapping up

- `git rebase` is a powerful tool
- `reflog` is a list of all the actions you've done in your repo, which contains the commit hash, the action, and the reflog message
- `git reflog` is a great way to recover lost commits
- `git cat-file -p <commit-hash>` to show the content of a commit. It's useful when you want to see the changes of a commit in list of reflog sha commits
- `git bisect` is a great way to find a bug in your code, it's a binary search for commits. Just need to run `git bisect start`, `git bisect bad`, `git bisect good <commit-hash>` and let git do the rest

- `git log --oneline` to show the commit history in one line
- `git log --oneline --graph --decorate` to show the commit history in one line with a graph
- `git log --oneline -p` to show the commit history in one line with the changes

- `git rebase -i HEAD~<number>` to squash number of last commits into one
- `git rebase -i <commit-hash>` to squash commits from a specific commit
- `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the last commit and keep the changes
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1` to undo the last commit and discard the changes
- `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` to reset to a specific commit and discard all changes

- `.git/info/exclude` to exclude files from being tracked by git, but it personal to the repo, meaning it won't be shared with others
- `rerere` is a git feature that allows you to record conflict resolutions and replay them in the future, stands for reuse recorded resolution. To enable it, run `git config --global rerere.enabled true`
- `git pull --rebase` to pull changes from the remote and rebase your changes on top of them. We prefer this over `git pull` because it keeps the history clean, especially when working with others in one branch that involves a lot of commits. It will make the history linear and easier to revert changes if needed
- `git revert <commit-hash>` to revert a commit, it will create a new commit that undoes the changes from the commit you want to revert
- `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` to pick a commit from another branch and apply it to the current branch
- `git stash` to stash changes and apply them later, it should come with a message to know what changes are stashed, e.g `git stash -m "save changes of feature A"`
- `git stash list` to list all stashes
- `git stash apply` to apply the last stash
- `git stash apply stash@{1}` to apply a specific stash
- `git stash pop` to apply the last stash and remove it from the list

- `git worktree add <path>` to add a new worktree to your repo, it's like having multiple branches checked out at the same time. It's useful when you want to work on multiple features at the same time without having to stash changes or create a new branch. Then just code and commit as usual, it will interact with the main branch as if it's a separate branch
- `git worktree list` to list all worktrees
- `git worktree remove <path>` to remove a worktree
- `git worktree prune` to remove all stale worktrees. After pruning, the commits still exist in the main worktree, but the worktree is removed
