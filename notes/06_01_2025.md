#### Graph

- Graph is a collection of nodes (vertex) and edges
- Graphs can be directed or undirected: meaning edges have direction or no direction
- Graphs can be cyclic or acyclic: meaning there are cycles or no cycles
- Graphs can be weighted or unweighted: meaning edges have weights or no weights
- Graphs can be connected or disconnected: meaning all nodes are connected or not connected
- Graphs can be represented as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list: meaning nodes are represented as a matrix or a list

#### Adjacency matrix

- A 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph
- A cell graph[i][j] = weight if there is an edge between vertices i and j
- A cell graph[i][j] = 0 if there is no edge between vertices i and j
- Pros:
  - Space efficient for representing dense graphs
  - Edge weight lookup is O(1)
- Cons:
  - Requires O(V^2) space
  - Iterating over all edges takes O(V^2) time
  - Adding a vertex takes O(V^2) time

example:

```js
const graph = [
	[0, 10, 0, 5],
	[1, 0, 1, 1],
	[0, 1, 7, 5],
	[0, 12, 8, 0],
];
```

#### Adjacency list

- An array of lists is used
- The size of the array is equal to the number of vertices
- An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex
- Pros:
  - Space efficient for representing sparse graphs
  - Iterating over all edges is efficient
  - Adding a vertex is easier
- Cons:
  - Less space efficient for representing dense graphs
  - Edge weight lookup is O(V)

example:

```js
const graph = {
	0: [
		{ to: 1, weight: 10 },
		{ to: 3, weight: 5 },
	],
	1: [
		{ to: 0, weight: 1 },
		{ to: 2, weight: 1 },
		{ to: 3, weight: 1 },
	],
	2: [
		{ to: 1, weight: 7 },
		{ to: 3, weight: 5 },
	],
	3: [
		{ to: 0, weight: 12 },
		{ to: 1, weight: 8 },
	],
};
```

==> we prefer adjacency list over adjacency matrix for most of the problems

#### Graph traversal

- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS)

#### Notes

- Graph is appeared in many real-world problems such as social networks, maps, networks, etc.
- All trees are graphs but not all graphs are trees
- We can use BFS and DFS to traverse a graph as we do with trees. But we need a "path" to keep track of visited nodes to avoid infinite loops
