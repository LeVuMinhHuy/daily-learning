#### What is JSX ?

##### My Answer: (4/10)

JSX is a new file format that allow us to include html elements inside javascript code, basically it's still javascript

##### Course answer:

JSX is short for Javascript XML, that allow us to write Javascript with an HTML-like template syntax

##### Additional notes from AI that hasn't been mentioned:

```JSX
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```

- It allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript

- JSX is neither pure JavaScript nor HTMLâ€”it's a syntax extension to JavaScript

- Since JSX is not valid JavaScript, it must be compiled using tools like Babel. It is transformed into React.createElement() calls under the hood.

- We can code React without using JSX, JSX is just a sugar syntax for React.createElement(). so we can write directly React.createElement() instead of JSX

- But why we need JSX? because it's more readable and easier to write than React.createElement(), and we don't need to write a lot of logic to manipulate the DOM

#### What is differnt between element and component in React

In react, element is something that created by JSX as an object that represent the DOM element, while component is a function that return JSX element

e.g:

```JSX
const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
```

In this case, `element` is an object that represent the DOM element `<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`

```JSX
function Welcome(props) {
  return <element />;
}
```

In this case, `Welcome` is a component that return JSX element `<element />`
