#### Tries (Trie Tree)

Trie - re"trie"val tree

this DS has been asked so frequently in interviews

the easiest way to think about a trie is to think of it as a "auto-complete" tree

e.g:

```
root
  c
    a
  r   t (isWord = true)
s    t  s (isWord = true)
    l
   e (isWord = true)
```

#### Algorithms

- Insert

1. start from the root
2. for each character in the word, check if the character exists in the current node
3. if the character does not exist, create a new node
4. move to the next node
5. repeat the process until the end of the word
6. mark the last node as a word

- search

1. start from the root
2. for each character in the word, check if the character exists in the current node
3. if the character does not exist, return false
4. move to the next node
5. repeat the process until the end of the word
6. check if the last node is a word

- delete (recursion approach)

1. start from the root
2. for each character in the word, check if the character exists in the current node
3. if the character does not exist, return false
4. move to the next node
5. repeat the process until the end of the word
6. mark the last node as not a word
7. if the last node has no children, delete the node
8. repeat the process recursively from the bottom up

#### Implementation

```js

class TrieNode {
  children: Record<string, TrieNode>;
  isEndOfWord: boolean;
  frequency: number; // Number of times the word is searched
  rank: number; // Rank based on popularity or other metrics

  constructor() {
    this.children = {};
    this.isEndOfWord = false;
    this.frequency = 0;
    this.rank = 0;
  }
}

class Trie {
  private root: TrieNode;

  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }

  // Insert a word into the trie
  insert(word: string): void {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!node.children[char]) {
        node.children[char] = new TrieNode();
      }
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    node.isEndOfWord = true;
  }

  // Delete a word from the trie
  // Delete should be implemented as recursive function because we need to delete the nodes from the bottom up
  delete(word: string): void {
    const deleteHelper = (currentNode: TrieNode, index: number): boolean => {
      if (index === word.length) {
        if (!currentNode.isEndOfWord) return false;
        currentNode.isEndOfWord = false;
        return Object.keys(currentNode.children).length === 0;
      }

      const char = word[index];
      if (!currentNode.children[char]) return false;

      const shouldDeleteCurrentNode = deleteHelper(currentNode.children[char], index + 1);
      if (shouldDeleteCurrentNode) {
        delete currentNode.children[char];
        return Object.keys(currentNode.children).length === 0;
      }

      return false;
    };

    deleteHelper(this.root, 0);
  }

  // Increment the frequency and update rank when a word is searched
  search(word: string): boolean {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of word) {
      if (!node.children[char]) return false;
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    if (node.isEndOfWord) {
      node.frequency++;
      node.rank = node.frequency; // Update rank (can be customized)
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  // Check if any word in the trie starts with the given prefix
  startsWith(prefix: string): boolean {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of prefix) {
      if (!node.children[char]) return false;
      node = node.children[char];
    }
    return true;
  }

  // Get auto-complete suggestions for a prefix
  getSuggestions(prefix: string): { word: string; rank: number; frequency: number }[] {
    let node = this.root;
    for (const char of prefix) {
      if (!node.children[char]) return [];
      node = node.children[char];
    }

    const results: { word: string; rank: number; frequency: number }[] = [];
    const collectWords = (currentNode: TrieNode, currentWord: string) => {
      if (currentNode.isEndOfWord) {
        results.push({
          word: currentWord,
          rank: currentNode.rank,
          frequency: currentNode.frequency,
        });
      }
      for (const char in currentNode.children) {
        collectWords(currentNode.children[char], currentWord + char);
      }
    };

    collectWords(node, prefix);

    // Sort suggestions by rank (descending) and then by frequency
    return results.sort((a, b) => b.rank - a.rank || b.frequency - a.frequency);
  }
}

// Usage
const trie = new Trie();
trie.insert("apple");
trie.insert("app");
trie.insert("application");

trie.search("app"); // Increment frequency for "app"
trie.search("apple"); // Increment frequency for "apple"
trie.search("apple"); // Increment frequency for "apple"

console.log(trie.getSuggestions("app"));
// Returns auto-complete suggestions sorted by rank and frequency

```

#### Complexity

- Insert: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Delete: O(n)
- Auto-complete: O(k log k) where k is the number of suggestions

If you're storing only English words in a Trie, the time complexity for insertion and search is not strictly O(1), but it can be considered O(1) in practice under certain conditions due to the following reasons:

Fixed Alphabet Size:

English words are composed of letters from the 26-character English alphabet.
In the Trie, each node has at most 26 children (one for each letter).
Word Length is Bounded:

English words have a finite maximum length. Most common words are relatively short (e.g., fewer than 20 characters).
If we consider a realistic fixed maximum word length L, the operations on a Trie are bounded by L, making the complexity effectively O(L), which is a constant for practical purposes.

Practical Complexity

- Insertion: O(L), where L is the length of the word.
- Search: O(L), same as insertion.

Since L is bounded and small for English words, we can treat O(L) as O(1) in practical terms.

#### Pros

- Fast lookups
- Auto-complete
- Prefix search

#### Cons

- Space complexity
- Slower than hash tables for exact match lookups

#### Use Cases

- Auto-complete (Google search, keyboard)
- Spell check
- Caching (Nextflix recommendations)

#### Notes

- In the interview, if interviewer asks you to implement something like auto-complete or caching system, you can think of using a Trie.
- Beside the list of children, you can store additional information in the TrieNode, such as frequency, rank, or any other metadata. This can be useful for ranking suggestions or customizing the Trie for specific use cases.
