#### Graph

#### DFS on Adjacency List

```js
function walk(
    graph: WeightedAdjacencyList,
    curr: number,
    needle: number,
    seen: boolean[],
    path: number[],
): boolean {
    // basecase
    if (curr === needle) {
        path.push(curr);
        return true;
    }

    if (seen[curr]) {
        return false;
    }

    seen[curr] = true;

    // recurse

    // prev
    path.push(curr);

    // recurse
    const edges = graph[curr];

    for (let i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        const edge = edges[i];

        if (walk(graph, edge.to, needle, seen, path)) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // post
    path.pop();

    return false;
}

export default function dfs(
    graph: WeightedAdjacencyList,
    source: number,
    needle: number,
): number[] | null {
    const seen: boolean[] = new Array(graph.length).fill(false);
    const path: number[] = [];

    walk(graph, source, needle, seen, path);

    if (!path.length) return null;

    return path;
}
```

#### Algorithm

- DFS on Adjacency List
- Because we are using adjacency list, we can just get the edges from the current node
- We can use `seen` array to mark the node as visited
- We can use `path` array to store the path that we've visited-
- We start at the source node and recurse to the next node until we find the needle
- If we find the needle, we can return the path
- If we don't find the needle, we can return null

#### Complexity

- Time: O(V + E)
- Space: O(V)

#### Notes

- DFS is a stack based algorithm, so in pre step, we push the current node to the path, and in post step, we pop the current node from the path. In between, we recurse to the next node
