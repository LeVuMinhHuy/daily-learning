#### Graph

#### DFS on Adjacency List

```js
function walk(
    graph: WeightedAdjacencyList,
    curr: number,
    needle: number,
    seen: boolean[],
    path: number[],
): boolean {
    // basecase
    if (curr === needle) {
        path.push(curr);
        return true;
    }

    if (seen[curr]) {
        return false;
    }

    seen[curr] = true;

    // recurse

    // prev
    path.push(curr);

    // recurse
    const edges = graph[curr];

    for (let i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
        const edge = edges[i];

        if (walk(graph, edge.to, needle, seen, path)) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // post
    path.pop();

    return false;
}

export default function dfs(
    graph: WeightedAdjacencyList,
    source: number,
    needle: number,
): number[] | null {
    const seen: boolean[] = new Array(graph.length).fill(false);
    const path: number[] = [];

    walk(graph, source, needle, seen, path);

    if (!path.length) return null;

    return path;
}
```

#### Algorithm

- DFS on Adjacency List
- Because we are using adjacency list, we can just get the edges from the current node
- We can use `seen` array to mark the node as visited
- We can use `path` array to store the path that we've visited-
- We start at the source node and recurse to the next node until we find the needle
- If we find the needle, we can return the path
- If we don't find the needle, we can return null

#### Complexity

- Time: O(V + E)
- Space: O(V)

#### Notes

- DFS is a stack based algorithm, so in pre step, we push the current node to the path, and in post step, we pop the current node from the path. In between, we recurse to the next node

#### Dijkstra's Shortest Path

```js
function hasUnvisited(seen: boolean[], dists: number[]): boolean {
    return seen.some((s, i) => !s && dists[i] < Infinity);
}

function getLowestUnvisited(seen: boolean[], dists: number[]): number {
    let idx = -1;
    let lowestDistance = Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < seen.length; i++) {
        if (seen[i]) {
            continue;
        }

        if (lowestDistance > dists[i]) {
            lowestDistance = dists[i];
            idx = i;
        }
    }

    return idx;
}

export default function dijkstra_list(
    source: number,
    sink: number,
    arr: WeightedAdjacencyList,
): number[] {
    const seen = new Array(arr.length).fill(false);
    const prev = new Array(arr.length).fill(-1);
    const dists = new Array(arr.length).fill(Infinity);

    dists[source] = 0;

    while (hasUnvisited(seen, dists)) {
        const curr = getLowestUnvisited(seen, dists);

        seen[curr] = true;

        const adjs = arr[curr];

        for (let i = 0; i < adjs.length; i++) {
            const edge = adjs[i];

            if (seen[edge.to]) {
                continue;
            }

            const dist = dists[curr] + edge.weight;

            if (dist < dists[edge.to]) {
                dists[edge.to] = dist;
                prev[edge.to] = curr;
            }
        }
    }

    const out: number[] = [];

    let curr = sink;

    while (prev[curr] !== -1) {
        out.push(curr);
        curr = prev[curr];
    }

    out.push(source);
    return out.reverse();
}
```

#### Algorithm

- check if there are any unvisited nodes

- get the lowest unvisited node

- mark the current node as visited

- get the adjacent nodes

- for each adjacent node, calculate the distance

- if the distance is less than the current distance, update the distance and the previous node

- repeat until there are no unvisited nodes

#### Complexity

- Time: O(V^2 + E)
- Space: O(V)

#### Notes

- Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from the source to the sink

- We should use a priority queue (min heap) to get the lowest unvisited node, that way we can reduce the time complexity to O(V log V + E)

- We will apply min heap to:
  - get the lowest unvisited node
  - update the distance
