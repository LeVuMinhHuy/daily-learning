#### What is the difference between the virtual DOM and the real DOM?

##### My answer:

the difference between virtual DOM and the real DOM is that React create virtual DOM to be like just a blueprint that keep watching what and where the real DOM should be updated, and do the update

##### Course answer:

Virtual DOM:

- can't directly update HTML

Real DOM:

- directly updates and manipulates HTML

Virtual DOM:

- acts as a copy of the real DOM, which can be frequently update without a page refresh

Real DOM:

- creates a new DOM/ full repaint if it is updated, so when we click a button action to update the content of the DOM, the page will be reloaded

Virtual DOM:

- more of a pattern than a specific technology, we can see it's in reactjs, vuejs, and other frameworks

Real DOM:

- an object-based representation of HTML document

Virtual DOM:

- sync with the real DOM with 'react-dom'

**But the key difference is : DIFFING**

what the virtual DOM does is looks at the diffrent between current state and the previous state to see what has been changed and just update that individual part of the DOM, rather than repaint the whole DOM

the real DOM when update it repaint the whole DOM and the page will be reloaded

##### Additional notes from AI that hasn't been mentioned:

- Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM. It's lightweight because it doesn’t include all the properties and methods associated with real DOM elements, which significantly reduces its size and complexity.

- When updates occur, the Virtual DOM calculates the difference (diff) between its previous and current state.

- How It Works in Steps:

  - Initial Render:

  The framework (e.g., React) creates a Virtual DOM tree that mirrors the real DOM.

  - Updates:

  When the state or props change, a new Virtual DOM is created.

  - Diffing:

  The framework compares the old and new Virtual DOM trees (diffing algorithm).

  - Reconciliation:

  Only the changes are applied to the real DOM, avoiding a complete re-render.

Definition

- Real DOM: The actual Document Object Model, a tree-like structure that represents the web page and is directly rendered in the browser. It’s what users see and interact with.

- Virtual DOM: A lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. It’s a JavaScript object that mirrors the real DOM structure.

Performance

- Real DOM:

  - Updates are slow because any modification requires recalculating styles, layout, and repainting the entire UI.

  - Each change directly affects the browser rendering, even for minor updates.

- Virtual DOM:

  - Updates are fast because changes are made in memory and compared with the previous virtual DOM (using a process called reconciliation).

  - Only the differences (a "diff") are applied to the real DOM, minimizing re-renders.

How Updates Work

- Real DOM:

  A single change (e.g., updating text or styles) triggers the browser to update the real DOM node, potentially leading to layout recalculations and repaints.

- Virtual DOM:

  When a state or property changes, the virtual DOM updates first.
  A diffing algorithm identifies changes between the new and old virtual DOM.
  Only the affected nodes are updated in the real DOM.

Example

Suppose you want to update a single <li> in a list of 100 items:

- Real DOM: The browser has to process changes, even if only one <li> is modified, potentially impacting performance.

- Virtual DOM: The framework identifies the change in one <li> and updates only the corresponding real DOM node, avoiding unnecessary recalculations.
