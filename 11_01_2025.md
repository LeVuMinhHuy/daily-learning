#### Selection sort

##### Algorithm

0. Loop i through the array, min_idx as i and loop j from i+1 to n
1. Find the smallest element in the array and swap it with the first element.
2. Keep doing this for the remaining elements.

##### Code

```python
def selection_sort(lst):
    """
    Selection sort function
    :param lst: List of integers
    """

    len_lst = len(lst);

    for i in range(len_lst):
        min_idx = i

        for j in range(i+1, len_lst):
            if (lst[j] < lst[min_idx]):
                min_idx = j

        lst[i], lst[min_idx] = lst[min_idx], lst[i]

# Driver code to test above
if __name__ == '__main__':

    lst = [3, 2, 1, 5, 4]
    selection_sort(lst)  # Calling selection sort function

    # Printing Sorted lst
    print("Sorted lst: ", lst)
```

##### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1)
